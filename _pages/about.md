My name is Julie Vaughn, and I am an M. Eng. student in the Szolovits lab at MIT CSAIL. I am passionate about the use of ML for equitable, effective, and accountable healthcare. 

Broadly, my research interests are in (1) ML for healthcare, (2) algorithmic fairness through causal frameworks, and (3) improving healthcare accessibility.
