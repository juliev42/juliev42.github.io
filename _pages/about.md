Hello, and welcome to my academic website! My name is Julie Vaughn, and I am passionate about the use of ML for equitable, effective, and accountable medicine and healthcare. I am currently a data scientist at Cellular Longevity, Inc. (dba Loyal) working on understanding aging. I graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT in 2020, with a minor in Biomedical Engineering. I completed my M. Eng. in 2021 at the Szolovits lab at MIT CSAIL.

Broadly, my research interests are in (1) ML for healthcare, (2) causal inference and algorithmic fairness, and (3) improving healthcare accessibility. Beyond MIT, I have also interned at Philips Research North America and several health tech startups. I enjoy teaching, writing, fitness, singing, advocacy, and learning in my free time.
