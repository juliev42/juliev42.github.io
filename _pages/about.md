Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Julie Vaughn, and I am passionate about the use of data and technology for equitable, effective, and accountable healthcare. I am currently working on a startup. Before that, I was a data scientist at Loyal for Dogs, where I helped develop statistical simulations for the first longevity clinical trial to recieve [protocol concurrence from the FDA] (https://loyalfordogs.com/posts/loyal-announces-historic-fda-milestone-for-large-dog-lifespan-extension-drug). I graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT in 2020, with a minor in Biomedical Engineering. I also completed a Master's degree focused on NLP for Healthcare in 2021 at the Szolovits lab at MIT CSAIL. During school, I completed internships at five healthcare companies, was part of the new Living Machines certificate program, and enjoyed teaching both at MIT and abroad.

Generally, my interests are in (1) improving women's health outcomes, (2) ethical and translatable AI for healthcare, and (3) personalized, preventative medicine and longevity. I informally advise early-stage founders and am happy to connect with likeminded folks. I also enjoy exploring, teaching, writing, dance, singing, advocacy, board games, and learning in my free time.
