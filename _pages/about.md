Hello, and welcome to my academic website! My name is Julie Vaughn, and I am an M. Eng. student in the Szolovits lab at MIT CSAIL. I am passionate about the use of ML for equitable, effective, and accountable healthcare. In May of 2020, I graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT, with a minor in Biomedical Engineering. 

Broadly, my research interests are in (1) ML for healthcare, (2) causal inference and algorithmic fairness, and (3) improving healthcare accessibility. Beyond MIT, I have also interned at Philips Research North America and several health tech startups. I enjoy teaching, writing, fitness, singing, advocacy, and learning in my free time.
