Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Julie Vaughn, and I am passionate about the use of data and technology for equitable, effective, and accountable medicine and healthcare. I am currently working on a startup. Before that, I worked with longevity data at Loyal for Dogs. I graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT in 2020, with a minor in Biomedical Engineering. I completed my M. Eng. in 2021 at the Szolovits lab at MIT CSAIL. 

Broadly, my interests are in (1) ML for healthcare, (2) causal inference and algorithmic fairness, and (3) improving healthcare accessibility. I've had the privilige to work and intern at a variety of health tech companies and research organizations and have some great mentors. I enjoy teaching, writing, fitness, dance, singing, advocacy, and learning in my free time. 

Please reach out to julie.r.vaughn@gmail.com if you'd like to get in touch!
