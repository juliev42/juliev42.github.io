I co-designed and co-taught a course on healthcare problem-solving to passionate students and professionals in Mumbai, India. The curriculum was focused on design thinking, teamwork, and communication skills. One of the teams we mentored, Medi-Assess, placed at the global 2020 Johns Hopkins Healthcare Design Competition.
