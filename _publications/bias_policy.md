In fall of 2019, I helped develop a policy paper describing a policy framework for addressing bias in medical diagnostic system. The paper combines some of the latest research from CSAIL on algorithmic bias (Suresh et al., 2019), and a deep dive into current FDA practices in regulated artificial intelligence. The paper outlines different kinds of interventions to prevent different varieties of bias that may arise during the data collection process. I am passionate about creating less biased and robust healthcare AI systems, and hope that through sharing this work I can spark conversations about the issue of bias in diagnostic AI. I am continuing to learn more about this area alongside my current Master's research. 

This work was also presented at the Women in Data Science @ Silicon Valley Conference in June. You can view a recording here:
