I designed a MATLAB application for a VA-supported project to create a patient monitoring system for paralyzed patients using Kinect sensor data. The application was meant to reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers by monitoring how often a patient is turned and then recommending that nurses turn the patient when over 2 hours have passed with the patient in a single position. In addition, I developed algorithms to model edema and blanket coverage monitoring. The latter work is patent-pending and was presented at the EMBC 2019 annual conference. My mentor was Dr. Saman Parvaneh at PRNA in summer 2018.
