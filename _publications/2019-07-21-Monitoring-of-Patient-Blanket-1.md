I designed a MATLAB application for a VA-supported project to create a patient monitoring system for paralyzed patients using Kinect sensor data. I used common machine learning algorithms to help detect if a patient is covered with a blanket, and immage processing techniques to determine if a patient had recently been repositioned. The work on blanket detection is patent-pending and was presented at the EMBC 2019 annual conference. My mentor was Dr. Saman Parvaneh at PRNA in summer 2018.
